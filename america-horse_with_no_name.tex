\begin{song}{Horse with no name}{E-moll}{1973}{America}{}{}
  \begin{SBVerse}
    \Ch{Em}{On} the first part of the \Ch{D6/9}{journey}

    I was lookin at all the life

    There were plants and birds and rocks and things

    There were sand and hills and rings
  \end{SBVerse}

  \begin{SBVerse}
    The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz

    and the sky with no clouds

    the heat was hot and the ground was dry

    but the air was full of sound
  \end{SBVerse}

  \begin{SBChorus}
    \Ch{Em9}{I've} been through the desert on a \Ch{Dm9}{horse} with no name

    it felt good to be out of the rain

    in the desert you can remember your name

    'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

    la la la  la lalala   la la  la  la la
  \end{SBChorus}

  \begin{SBVerse}
    After two days in the desert sun

    my skin began to turn red

    After three days in the desert fun

    I was looking at a river bed

    And the story it told of a river that flowed

    made me sad to think it was dead
  \end{SBVerse}

  \begin{SBChorus}
    CHORUS
  \end{SBChorus}

  \begin{SBVerse}
    After nine days I let the horse run free

    'cause the desert had turned to sea

    there were plants and birds and rocks and things

    there were sand and hills and rings

    The ocean is a desert with it's life underground

    and the perfect disguise above

    Under the cities lies a heart made of ground

    but the humans will give no love
  \end{SBVerse}
