About you \[C(9)]now \[Dsus2 A7sus4]
\endverse
\beginverse
Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out

But you never really had a doubt

\endverse
\beginverse
And \[C]all the roads we \[D]have to walk are \[E\mi]winding
And \[C]all the lights that \[D]lead us there are \[E\mi]blinding

\[G]Like to \[\dsusoverfis]{say to} \[E\mi]you
But I \[G]don't know \[A7sus4]how
\endverse

\endchorus
\beginverse
Today was gonna be the day

By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now
