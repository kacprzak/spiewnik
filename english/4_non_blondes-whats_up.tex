\beginverse
\[A]Twenty-five years and my life is still
\[B\mi]Trying to get up that great big hill of \[D]hope
For a desti\[A]nation
\endverse
\beginverse
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means
\endverse
\beginverse
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
\endverse
\beginverse
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?
\endverse
\beginchorus
And I say, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
I said hey, what's going on?

And I say, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
I said hey, what's going on?

Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
\endchorus
\beginverse
And I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time, in this institution
\endverse
\beginverse
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution.
\endverse
\beginverse
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
\endverse
\beginverse
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?

For a destination
