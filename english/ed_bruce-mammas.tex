\beginsong{Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys}[cr={1975},by={Ed and Patsy Bruce}]
  \beginchorus
    \[C]{Mammas} don't let your babies grow up to be \[F]{cowboys}
    Don't \[G7]{let} them pick guitars and drive in old trucks
    Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and \[C]{such}
    Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be \[F]{cowboys}
    They'll \[G7]{never} stay home and they're always alone
    Even with someone they \[C]{love}
  \endchorus
  \beginverse
    Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to \[F]{hold}
    And \[G7]{they'd} rather give you a song than diamonds or \[C]{gold}
    Lone Star belt buckles and old faded Levis
    And each \[F]{night} begins a new day
    And if \[G7]{you} don't understand him and he don't die young
    He'll probably just ride \[C]{away}
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
    \[C]Mammas \dots
  \endchorus
  \beginverse
    A cowboy loves smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain \[F]{mornings}
    \[G7]{Little} warm puppies and children and girls of the \[C]{night}
    Them that don't know him won't like him
    And them that do \[F]{sometimes} won't know how to take him
    He's not \[G7]{wrong} he's just different and his pride won't let him
    Do things to make you think he's \[C]{right}
  \endverse
