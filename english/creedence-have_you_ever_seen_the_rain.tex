\beginverse
{\nolyrics Intro: \[A\mi F C G]}
\[C]Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm,
I \[G]know; it's been coming \[C]for some time.
\[C]When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day,
\[G]{I know}; shining down like \[C]water. \[C7]
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[F] I want to \[G]know, have you \[C]ever \[\coverb]seen the \[A\mi]rain? \[\amioverg]
\[F] I want to \[G]know, have you \[C]ever \[\coverb]seen the \[A\mi]rain \[\amioverg]
\[F] Coming \[G]down on a sunny \[C]day?
\endchorus
\beginverse
Yesterday, and days before,
Sun is cold and rain is hard,
I know; been that way for all my time.

'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow,
I know; it can't stop, I wonder.
\endverse
\beginchorus
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?

Yeah!

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?
\endchorus
