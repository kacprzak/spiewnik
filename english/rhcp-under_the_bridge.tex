\[E]Sometimes I \[B]feel like I \[C#\mi]don't have a \[G#\mi]part\[A]ner
\[E]Sometimes I \[B]feel like \[C#\mi]my only \[A]friend
Is the \[E]city I \[B]live in, the \[C#\mi]city of \[G#\mi]an\[A]gels
\[E]Lonely as \[B]{I am}, to\[C#\mi]gether we \[A]cry \[E\majseven]
\endverse
\beginverse
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worry, now that is a lie
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[F#\mi]{I don't} ever want to \[E]feel
\[B] Like I \[F#\mi]did that day
\[F#\mi]Take me to the place I \[E]love
\[B] Take me \[F#\mi]all the way
\[F#\mi]{I don't} ever want to \[E]feel
\[B] Like I \[F#\mi]did that day
\[F#\mi]Take me to the place I \[E]love
\[B] Take me \[F#\mi]all the way
\[E](yeah \[B]yeah) \[C#\mi] \[G#\mi] \[A] | \[E] \[B] \[C#\mi] \[A]
\endchorus
\beginverse
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[F#\mi]{I don't} ever want to \[E]feel
\[B] Like I \[F#\mi]did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
