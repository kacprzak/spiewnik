\beginverse

She took me in and gave me breakfast ... and she said

Where beer does flow and men chunder

You better run, you better take cover ... yeah

Lyin' in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me
Because I come from the land of plenty?" ... And he said
