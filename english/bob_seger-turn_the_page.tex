\beginsong{Turn the Page}[cr={1973},by={Bob Seger}]

  \beginverse
    \[E\mi]{On a} long and lonely highway east of omaha
    you can \[D]{listen} to the engine, moanin out as one long song
    you can \[A]{think} about the woman, or the girl you knew the night \[E\mi]{before}
  \endverse
  \beginverse
    and your thoughts will soo be wandering the way they always do
    when your riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
    you don't feel much like travelin', you just wish the trip was through
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
    but here I \[D]{am}, on the road \[E\mi]{again}
    here I \[D]{am}, up on the \[E\mi]{stage}
    here I \[D]{go}, playing the \[A]{star} again
    there I \[C]{go}, \[D]{turn} the \[E\mi]{page}
  \endchorus
  \beginverse
    you walk into a restaraunt, strung out from the road
    and you feel the eyes opon you, as your shaking off the cold
    you pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
  \endverse
  \beginverse
    sometimes you hear 'em talkin', other times you can't
    all the same 'ole cliche's is that a woman or a man
    and you always seem outnumbered, you dare not make a stand
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
    But here I am, \dots
  \endchorus
  \beginverse
    out there in the spotlight, your a million miles away
    every ounce of energy, you try to give away
    and the sweat pours from your body, like the music that you play
  \endverse
  \beginverse
    later on that evening, as you lie awake in bed
    echos of the amplifiers, ringin in your head
    and you smoke the days last cigarette, remembering what you said
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
    But here I am, \dots \rep{2}
  \endchorus
