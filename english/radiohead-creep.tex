When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
\endverse
\beginverse
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
\endverse
\beginchorus
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
\endchorus
\beginverse
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul
\endverse
\beginverse
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
\endverse
\beginchorus
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run

Run
\endchorus
\beginverse
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
\endverse
\beginchorus
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
\endchorus
