\begin{song}{Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys}{C}{1975}{Ed and Patsy Bruce}{}{}
  \begin{SBChorus}

    \Ch{C}{Mammas} don't let your babies grow up to be \Ch{F}{cowboys}

    Don't \Ch{G7}{let} them pick guitars and drive in old trucks

    Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and \Ch{C}{such}

    Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be \Ch{F}{cowboys}

    They'll \Ch{G7}{never} stay home and they're always alone

    Even with someone they \Ch{C}{love}
  \end{SBChorus}

  \begin{SBVerse}
    Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to \Ch{F}{hold}

    And \Ch{G7}{they'd} rather give you a song than diamonds or \Ch{C}{gold}

    Lone Star belt buckles and old faded Levis

    And each \Ch{F}{night} begins a new day

    And if \Ch{G7}{you} don't understand him and he don't die young

    He'll probably just ride \Ch{C}{away}
  \end{SBVerse}
  \begin{SBChorus}
    CHORUS
  \end{SBChorus}

  \begin{SBVerse}

    A cowboy loves smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain \Ch{F}{mornings}

    \Ch{G7}{Little} warm puppies and children and girls of the \Ch{C}{night}

    Them that don't know him won't like him

    And them that do \Ch{F}{sometimes} won't know how to take him

    He's not \Ch{G7}{wrong} he's just different and his pride won't let him

    Do things to make you think he's \Ch{C}{right}
  \end{SBVerse}
  \begin{SBChorus}
