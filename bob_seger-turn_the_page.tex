\begin{song}{Turn the Page}{E-moll}{1973}{Bob Seger}{}{}

  \begin{SBVerse}
    \Ch{Em}{On a} long and lonely highway east of omaha

    you can \Ch{D}{listen} to the engine, moanin out as one long song

    you can \Ch{A}{think} about the woman, or the girl you knew the night \Ch{Em}{before}
  \end{SBVerse}
  \begin{SBVerse}
    and your thoughts will soo be wandering the way they always do

    when your riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do

    you don't feel much like travelin', you just wish the trip was through
  \end{SBVerse}
  \begin{SBChorus}
    but here I \Ch{D}{am}, on the road \Ch{Em}{again}

    here I \Ch{D}{am}, up on the \Ch{Em}{stage}

    here I \Ch{D}{go}, playing the \Ch{A}{star} again

    there I \Ch{C}{go}, \Ch{D}{turn} the \Ch{Em}{page}
  \end{SBChorus}
  \begin{SBVerse}
    you walk into a restaraunt, strung out from the road

    and you feel the eyes opon you, as your shaking off the cold

    you pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
  \end{SBVerse}
  \begin{SBVerse}
    sometimes you hear 'em talkin', other times you can't

    all the same 'ole cliche's is that a woman or a man

    and you always seem outnumbered, you dare not make a stand
  \end{SBVerse}
  \begin{SBChorus}
    CHORUS
  \end{SBChorus}
  \begin{SBVerse}
    out there in the spotlight, your a million miles away

    every ounce of energy, you try to give away

    and the sweat pours from your body, like the music that you play
  \end{SBVerse}
  \begin{SBVerse}
    later on that evening, as you lie awake in bed

    echos of the amplifiers, ringin in your head

    and you smoke the days last cigarette, remembering what you said
  \end{SBVerse}
  \begin{SBChorus}
    CHORUS 2x
  \end{SBChorus}
\end{song}
